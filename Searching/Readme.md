Input

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements in the set (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n numbers a1, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The third line contains a single integer m, the number of queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The next line contains m numbers q1, ..., qn (1 ≤ qi ≤ 109)

Output

Output m numbers, the answers to the queries in the given order.
